the mother’s original proposal for frequent weekend/midweek time was unworkable.\n- Pivotal Finding: The trial judge did not improperly elevate the interests of the mother’s partner over the father/children; consideration of whether the partner could relocate was treated as part of the practical options analysis.\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 60CC (best interests factors)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 65DAA (equal time;

he did not remember details; he believed Recital N recorded the nature of the advice he was given.\n- Legal Advice: Full Court held that although the trial judge's reasoning about 'otherwise' was erroneous, the evidence permitted inference that advice about advantages and disadvantages was given (via advice on prudence and fair/reasonable).\n- Legal Advice: Murphy J agreed agreement was binding but considered trial judge misdirected herself by focusing only on the phrase 'advantage, financially or otherwise' rather than all advice components in the recital/certificates.\n- Pressure/Duress: Trial judge made adverse findings about appellant's conduct in the relationship financial dealings, including findings described as unconscionable and exploitative in the context of s 90UJ(1A) discussion (not a formal set-aside determination under duress provisions in this appeal excerpt).\n- Changed Circumstances: Change of circumstances was noted as not to be considered in the Hoult factors context (as discussed by Full Court), but no particular changes were identified."}, {"section": "reasons_rationale", "text": "- Reasons: The Full Court held there is no necessary conflict between being in a de facto relationship and contemplating marriage;

therefore having both agreements in one document does not make s 90UJ(3) nugatory.\n- Reasons: On advice: although the phrase 'advantage, financially or otherwise' does not itself equate to 'advantages and disadvantages', the evidence of advice as to prudence and whether terms were fair and reasonable permitted inference that disadvantages were also addressed.\n- Reasons: On s 90UJ(1A) contentions: the trial judge's consideration of the parties' actions and intention to have an agreement in place was relevant, and the asserted reliance on 'fairness of terms' was not supported by the reasons.\n- Reasons: Costs followed the event;

this supported concurrency.\n- Pivotal Finding: The agreements are complementary: a s 90UC agreement can be binding while parties remain de facto and ceases on marriage (s 90UJ(3)), while a s 90B agreement operates only upon marriage and relevant breakdown.\n- Pivotal Finding: Ground 2: trial judge erred in construing 'advantage, financially or otherwise' as necessarily including disadvantage; however, the Full Court inferred from advice on prudence and fair/reasonable that the appellant was advised of advantages and disadvantages, so s 90UJ(1)(b) was satisfied.\n- Pivotal Finding: No error shown in the trial judge's approach to s 90UJ(1A); references to parties' steps and intentions were relevant and not an impermissible fairness assessment of agreement terms (as characterised on appeal).\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 90UC (Part VIIIAB financial agreement while in de facto relationship)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 90UJ(1) (binding requirements, including legal advice about effect and advantages/disadvantages)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 90UJ(3) (Part VIIIAB agreement ceases to be binding if parties marry)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 90B (Part VIIIA financial agreement before marriage) and s 90G (analogous binding requirements for Part VIIIA agreements)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 90UJ(1A) (court power to declare agreement binding if unjust and inequitable for it not to be binding, raised as alternative)\n- Statutory Pivot: Authorities referenced on strict compliance and remedial amendments: Black and Black;

found relocation at that time likely to prevent meaningful relationship development and likely sever sibling relationship development\n- Best Interests: Trial judge considered protection from harm (s 60CC(2)(b)) and found continued unsupervised time did not present unacceptable risk on the evidence, while still expressing significant concerns about father's long-term maintenance of a drug/crime free lifestyle\n- Best Interests: Full Court held there was no undue elevation of s 60CC(2)(a) given the issue joined was the extent of relationship possible if relocated;

the reasons addressed risk of harm (s 60CC(2)(b)), father's drug/criminal history, parenting capacity, and the mother's circumstances and the claimed benefits of Europe.\n- Reasons: Many alleged errors were re-framed as disagreements with the weight given to factors, which do not establish appellate error absent House v The King principles.\n- Reasons: A trial judge is not required to make findings on every contested matter if the essential grounds for decision are articulated; ultimate findings about father's history and concerns were made.\n- Reasons: Expert evidence supported findings that annual visits and Skype were unlikely to maintain/develop the relationship for a child of this age; findings were open on the evidence.\n- Reasons: The Full Court emphasised the discretionary, predictive nature of parenting and relocation decisions and that different judges might reach different reasonable outcomes without establishing error."}, {"section": "impact_analysis", "text": "- Pivotal Finding: At trial, it was not in issue that the child would live with the mother, nor that the child should have an ongoing relationship with the father; the controversy was whether the relationship could be maintained/developed if the child relocated to Europe\n- Pivotal Finding: The trial judge found the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in s 61DA did not apply due to family violence (property damage incidents)\n- Pivotal Finding: The trial judge accepted expert evidence that, given the child's age and the early/embryonic stage of the father-child relationship, annual visits plus Skype were unlikely to maintain or develop a meaningful relationship, with a real risk of decline\n- Pivotal Finding: The trial judge found relocation would likely prevent any real chance for the child to develop a relationship with the half-sister\n- Pivotal Finding: The trial judge did not make a positive finding that the father had fully reformed; rather, she shared 'substantial concerns' about his capacity to maintain a drug- and crime-free lifestyle, while finding no unacceptable risk on the evidence of recent contact\n- Pivotal Finding: On appeal, the Full Court found no demonstrated legal error, no failure to decide necessary factual issues, and no material factual errors;

the wife’s text message responses supported her claim of reliance and surprise when the husband demanded sale/buyout in 2016.\n- Reasons: Hardship was established because the wife’s present entitlements were materially lower than what she might obtain and she had limited income and debts;

the evidence supported fund growth rather than substantial post-separation contributions, making the error material to the assessment of contributions and prospects.\n- Pivotal Finding: The wife had a prima facie case/real probability of success for a property adjustment that would yield her a significantly greater benefit than her current entitlements, taking into account her parenting and financial responsibilities post-separation and her indirect contributions to the husband’s termination entitlements and superannuation.\n- Pivotal Finding: Hardship was established because refusal of leave would likely deprive the wife of a meaningful opportunity to improve her financial position and rehousing prospects beyond current legal interests, given her limited income and debts associated with children’s schooling.\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 44(3) (leave required to institute property proceedings after 12 months post-divorce)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 44(4) (hardship threshold for granting leave)\n- Statutory Pivot: Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) s 79 and s 79(4) (power and considerations for property settlement;
